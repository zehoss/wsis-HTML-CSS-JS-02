            Why do we use it?
            <br/>
            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
            looking at
            its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as
            opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
            packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem
            ipsum'
            will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes
            by
            accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                industry's
                standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it
                to
                make
                a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                typesetting,
                remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                containing
                Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
                versions
                of Lorem Ipsum.

                Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
                Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
                Lorem
                Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
                undoubtable
                source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The
                Extremes
                of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very
                popular
                during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line
                in
                section 1.10.32.
